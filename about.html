    <h2>About Brielle</h2>
   
    <p>My passion lies in supporting small and medium sized businesses and community organizations connect with the right people through good design. Helping people bring their visions to life and giving people the tools to build their dreams is what I love to do, I just happen to do it through art and design.</p>
    
    <p>I believe that all good design begins with a story and understanding the why behind what drives you. This part of <a href="#our-process">our process</a> is what sets us apart. Bringing your vision to life through collaboration we create seamless designs that share your story with the world.</p>
    <p>With over 15 years in sales and marketing I combine my passion for creating clear, inspiring visuals with a deep understanding of brand, advertising and online marketing to help you reach your goals.</p>
    
    <h3>Her Story</h3>
    <p>Prior to the global pandemic, Brielle worked in sales and event management. When the pandemic shuttered the events industry, she dedicated herself to her family and launching her own design agency. During recent years Brielle has found a passion for creating clear, inspiring communication using digital platforms including social media, web and many other forms of design.</p>
    <p>When Brielle was pregnant with her first child, she was working in a corporate environment and putting in over 50 hours a week. She, like many parents, was overwhelmed with balancing a corporate career, spending time with her family and creating space for her passion, a love of art and design.</p>
    <p>Prior to the global pandemic, Brielle worked in sales and event management. When the pandemic shuttered the events industry, she found herself turning to art and other creative outlets to keep herself going through those overwhelming times.  One day she stumbled across a quote that said “love what you do, do what you love” and she knew this was the perfect opportunity to refocus and turn her, at the time hobby, into her career.</p>
    <p>Fast forward a few years and Brielle launched BH Design Studio.  BH Design Studio is a combination of passion and knowledge; bringing Brielle’s passion for design and her decades long experience in sales and marketing together to help her clients reach their goals and feel empowered to grow their organizations.</p>
